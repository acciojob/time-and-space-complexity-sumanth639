	 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
      Time complexity refers to how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. 
      Understanding <b>Time complexity</b> helps us determine whether an algorithm is efficient 
      and suitable for large-scale data processing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Space Complexity</b> describes the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to its input size. 
      When analyzing Space Complexity, we often express it using notations like O(n) to understand how 
      memory consumption grows.
